gulp-ember-template
===================

A template for building ember apps with gulp.  I am still new to gulp, so please feel free to comment, fork, send a PR, etc...

Getting Started
===============

* clone repo
* run `npm install`
* run `gulp`


Note: I didn't use bower because I prefer to add my vendor files manually - I seem to always run into problems using bower.
